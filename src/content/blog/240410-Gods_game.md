In a world of idle gods, humans are forced into brain challenges with them. 
With three defeats, gods lose their right to challenge, while 10 victories spell human triumph. 

Fay, determined to achieve the impossible, enters the ultimate test of wits against the gods. 

Will he defy divinity or is he just another loss in the making?
