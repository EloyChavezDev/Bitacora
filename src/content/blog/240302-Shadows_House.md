High atop a cliff sits the mansion known as Shadows House, home to a faceless clan that pretends to live like nobles. 

They express their emotions through living dolls that also endlessly clean the home of soot. One such servant, Emilico, aids her master Kate as they learn more about themselves and the mysteries of the house.
