Stars are everything, granting abilities to Tamers. So when Ivy was born without one, her village took it as an ill omen! Now banished, she leads a lonely life of salvaging rubbish to survive. 

That is until she befriends Sora, a weak little slime, in the forest. 

Together, the delicate duo embarks on a heartwarming journey of survival and discovers thereâ€™s more to Ivy than being starless.
