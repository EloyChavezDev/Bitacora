Welcome to part three (and the finale) of the Linux Fundamentals module. So far, throughout the series, you have got hands-on with some fundamental concepts and used some important commands. 

This room is going to showcase some useful utilities and applications that you are likely to use day-to-day. 

You're also going to advance your Linux-fu skills by learning about automation, package management, and service/application logging.
